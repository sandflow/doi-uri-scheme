1.  Introduction

   A DOI name is a global unique identifier of a referent, which can be
   any digital, physical or abstract entity, including inventions,
   literary and artistic works, ideas, symbols, names, images, designs,
   etc.  DOI names are, for example, widely used to identify academic
   publications.  The DOI system is specified in [iso26324] and
   [doi-handbook], with the former offering regular formal snapshot of
   the latter.

   EXAMPLE 1: The DOI name "10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381" refers to the
   article Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld, "Self-organized
   criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise", Phys.  Rev. Lett. 59,
   381.

   A DOI name is persistent over time.  This persistence is provided by
   the independence of the DOI name from the referent itself and its
   descriptive elements.  These descriptive elements of a referent,
   including location and ownership, can change over time, and their
   current values are retrieved by resolving the DOI name.  The set of
   elements retrieved by resolving a DOI name is called the DOI record.
   The DOI name resolution process uses the Handle System specified at
   [RFC3650], [RFC3651] and [RFC3652], as updated by [DOI-RP].

   This document specifies a URI scheme for DOI names.  This scheme
   formalizes the notation "doi:<DOI name>", which is in widespread use.
   When resolved, the URI corresponding to a DOI name yields the DOI
   record associated with the name.

   EXAMPLE 2: "doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381" is the URI corresponding
   to the DOI name above.

   This document intended to satisfy the guidelines and registration
   procedures specified at [RFC7595].

2.  Syntax

   As specified at [iso26324], a DOI name consists of an ordered
   sequence of Unicode code points of the Graphic type.

   The scheme-specific-part of the URI corresponding to a given DOI
   name, i.e., the DOI Name URI, SHALL be equal to the result of the
   following ordered sequence of steps:

   1.  express the ordered sequence of Unicode code points that comprise
       the DOI name as a UTF-8 String, as defined at [iso10646], without
       the byte order mark and without any normalization;

   2.  percent-encode any byte in the UTF-8 String that is neither
       unreserved nor equal to "/".

   The URI shall contain neither a query component nor a fragment
   component.

   EXAMPLE 1: The DOI name "10.5594/SMPTE.ST2067-21.2020" corresponds to
   the URI <doi:10.5594/SMPTE.ST2067-21.2020>.

   EXAMPLE 2: The DOI name "10.26321/Á.GUTIÉRREZ.ZARZA.02.2018.03" with
   the code point sequence <U+0031, U+0030, U+002E, U+0032, U+0036,
   U+0033, U+0032, U+0031, U+002F, U+00C1, U+002E, U+0047, U+0055,
   U+0054, U+0049, U+00C9, U+0052, U+0052, U+0045, U+005A, U+002E,
   U+005A, U+0041, U+0052, U+005A, U+0041, U+002E, U+0030, U+0032,
   U+002E, U+0032, U+0030, U+0031, U+0038, U+002E, U+0030, U+0033>
   corresponds to the URI
   <doi:10.26321/%C3%81.GUTI%C3%89RREZ.ZARZA.02.2018.03>.

   NOTE 1: The sequence of code points comprising a DOI name is not
   normalized and equivalence between DOI names is based on code points.
   For example, two DOI names that differ only in the abstract character
   "Á" being encoded as <U+00C1> in the first and as <U+0041, U+0301> in
   the second are not identical.

   NOTE 2: Presenting a DOI name by rendering its sequence of code
   points to glyphs can be ambiguous since multiple code points or
   sequences of code points can result in the same glyphs.  For example,
   U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+2212 MINUS SIGN and U+2013 EN DASH are
   rendered as similar glyphs.  As another example, the abstract
   character "á" can be represented by either the code point U+00E1 or
   the sequence of code points <U+0061, U+0301>.  Presenting a DOI name
   in its URI form resolves this ambiguity.

   NOTE 3: DOI names are case-insensitive only when testing for
   equivalence and only with respect to the Basic Latin Unicode block.

3.  Resolution

   Resolving a DOI name means retrieving its DOI record, which contains
   the descriptive elements associated with the referent identified by
   the DOI name.

   A DOI name URI can be be resolved by performing an HTTP GET request
   at the following URL (expresssed using ABNF syntaxt as defined at
   [RFC5234]):

   "https://doi.org/api/handles/" scheme-specific-part

   where scheme-specific-part is the scheme-specific-part of the DOI
   name URI, as defined at Section 2.

   The body of the response is a JSON object, as defined at [RFC8259],
   that contains the following members:

   responseCode
      The property is a Number.  The following values are defined:

      1  The resolution completed successfully.  The HTTP response
         status code is 200.

      2  The resolution did not complete successfully because of a
         server error.  The HTTP response status code is 500.

      100  The DOI name was not found.  The HTTP response status code is
         404.

      200  No descriptive elements were found for the requested DOI
         name.  The HTTP response status code is 200.

   handle
      The property is a String.  It is equal to the DOI name for which
      resolution was requested.

   values
      The property is an Object.  It contains the descriptive elements
      for the referent identified by the DOI name.  The contents of the
      property are specified at [RFC3651].

   Figure 1 illustrates the DOI record, at the time of this writing, for
   the DOI name corresponding to the URI <doi:10.1000/182>.  The DOI
   record was retrieved by performing an HTTP GET request to
   <https://doi.org/api/handles/10.1000/182>.
